            I am originally born in Canada. Then I moved to the States when I was 11. I went to Albany High, which is around 15 minutes
            from Berkeley. I have an older brother, and a younger twin sister.

        <ul>
            <li>I learned that there are practices that can increase one's intuition about design. I also learned that taking apart common apps can be helpful for this.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article was the animations of the apps being taken apart. It made it really easy to imagine the design process.</li>
            <li>"If you could see the harsh drop shadows and unnecessary flourish I added to things, you would gasp in horror."</li>
