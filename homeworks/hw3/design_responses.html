						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that simple texts are the most important aspect of creating an interface. It is not necessarily that the fanciest/most beautiful text is most suitable. This is very different than art. There are practical purposes. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favourite part of the article was that they took time to compile such good resources. Down to text sizing and pairing, there is a resource. It is great to keep as a reference in the future. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> When choosing type, take into account your audience and their needs. Simply put, empathize with your users.
