				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that as a UX designers we need to be responsible for deceptive user interfaces. There were many examples of this, such as bait and switch and continuity and fake news. These were often motivated by making more revenue through emphasizing ads and also furthering political agendas.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favourite part about the article was the real world examples, in places I wouldn't even think about, such as Ipsy. Ux/ui sometimes seems far removed and an 'addition' that is more recent to tech. However, UX informs the ethics of a lot of important parts of the world. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> We help shape the lives of people everywhere and our decisions can have significant impacts on the way we as a society behave. </p>
