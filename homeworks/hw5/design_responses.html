                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I've learned a lot of some of the basic aspects to good design. Even though all the designs were very sophisticated, they had an element of simplicity to them. Animations were added in a way that enhanced and didn't distract from the user experience of the product. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I really liked looking at the design elements that the designers used. It was pretty clear that they had some art backgrounds. Every interface was also like art. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I liked dark for green chameleon. I like how where the cursor is moved the setting. It reminded me of a virtual reality experience. On top of that, this website has a lot of dramatic emotiveness. The image of that person in the dark forest evokes a strong sense of emotion, yet the website is not overcrowded. I also liked the fantasy vibes it had. </p>
